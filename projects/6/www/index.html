        <h3>What are Opera Warriors ?</h3>
        <p>Opera Warriors are a collection of programmatically, randomly generated NFTs based on the Ethereum blockchain. The 1st generation consists of 10,000 randomly assembled warriors from over 100M total options. All the elements of Opera Warriors come from the trait of traditional Peking Operas. Each Opera Warrior is comprised of a unique color, eyes, eyebrow, cheek, chin-the possibilities are endless!</p>

        <h3>How tough is my warrior ?</h3>
        <div class="content">First of all, all warriors are brave enough and qualified to fight in the ancient arena. Each warrior has 4 basic combat attributes——minATK, maxATK, DEF, HP. The points of each attribute are determined by which elements your warrior is made up of.<br>These attributes are vital when they fight in the arena, and they’ll be even more important for breeding new warriors.<br>Beware, 108 famous heroes active throughout ancient Chinese history will be hidden among all 10,000 warriors. These heroes will be more powerful in the battle. If you’re lucky enough to get one, make sure you hold on to it, and make the most advantage of it.</div>

          <h3>Future of Opera Warriors</h3>
          <div class="content">Opera Warriors are much more than an NFT project. We have plans and hopes to build an Opera Warriors ecosystem comprised of interactivity and utility, community rewards and growth, collaboration with brands, and much more! We want the community to help dictate and determine which features we should be focusing on next – so you guys will be heavily involved in the future of Opera Warriors!<br>Step by step, we’ll release several games and use our tools and systems to connect each game. Our Opera Warrior owners can enjoy every game freely and earn tokens that come with the game. Utilizing the tools we provide, our players can also transfer their assets from one game to another. Of course, all the assets our players gained in the game belong to them; they can trade them on the market like Opensea without any permission.</div>

        <dt>What’s an NFT ?</dt>
        <dd>An NFT stands for "Non-fungible token" and is a fancy way of saying it's a unique, digital item type that users can buy, own, and trade. NFTs are fantastic digital art and additional utility like exclusive access to websites or participation in an event. Think of it like a rare piece of art that can also act as a "members" card.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>What is Metamask ?</dt>
        <dd>Metamask is a crypto wallet that can store your Ethereum and is needed to purchase and mint an Opera Warrior. Having a wallet gives you an Ethereum address (i.e., 0x71F5….8529); this is where your NFT will be stored. Learn more about Metamask and how easy it is to use over here!  (<a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">https://metamask.io/</a>)</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Where does my NFT go after I purchase an Opera Warrior ?</dt>
        <dd>Your Opera Warrior NFT will appear in whatever address or connected wallet you used to purchase the Opera Warrior. You can see your Opera Warrior here from our website by clicking My Warriors(the page will be ready in phase 2) or view them on Opensea.(<a href="https://opensea.io/collection/operawarrior" target="_blank">https://opensea.io/collection/operawarrior</a>)</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>How do I get involved ?</dt>
        <dd>Own your unique Opera Warrior, get in the battle in the arena, win your fortune and glories. Head over to the Discord, jump in on the conversation, and let us know your ideas!</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Arena? Is that what I’m thinking ?</dt>
        <dd>Yes! It will come in Phase 3. You can fight with other guys with your warriors and earn many fortunes by winning!</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>What can I do with my Opera Warriors ?</dt>
        <dd>You can participate in the arena fight, grow your warrior to become more powerful, trade the warrior on Opeansea, etc.<br>But at the start, you can use the Opera Warriors as your profile picture.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Are Opera Warriors a good investment ?</dt>
        <dd>That is ultimately a decision for you to make. We believe Opera Warriors have a long life ahead and will be an ever-growing and evolving project. However, the success of Opera Warriors relies on so many factors and variables, no one knows! Hopefully, Opera Warriors go to the moon, but like anything in life, don't spend money you can't afford to have.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Tokenomics ?</dt>
        <dd>We have reserved 100 warriors to giveaway in competitions and holder airdrops. Most of these will be given out after launch and will not occupy the early token ids. The remainder of the warriors is all for sale.</dd>
